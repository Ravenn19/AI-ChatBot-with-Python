# 🤖 AI ChatBot with Python

This project demonstrates a simple yet functional **AI ChatBot built using Python**. The bot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with `NLTK` and a `TF-IDF`-based similarity system to simulate human-like conversations.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a rule-based chatbot that can understand and respond to basic queries.
- Apply NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.
- Calculate similarity using **TF-IDF and cosine similarity**.
- Provide an extendable structure for future AI/NLP enhancements.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: User input is normalized and tokenized.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts the text into numerical vectors.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Compares user input with known sentences (knowledge base).
4. **Best Match Response**: Bot replies with the most relevant answer from its knowledge base.
